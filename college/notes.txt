fcfs/fifo scheduling algo
simplest

when a process enters ready queue, its PCB(process controlled block) will be
linked to the tail of the queue

when the CPU is free, it is allocated to the process at the head of the queue, 
the running process is then removed from the queue

waiting time is very long, as each process has to wait in the queue for v. long
also, since the burst time may differ and the process order is changed, the avg 
waiting time varies alot.

FCFS scheduling algorithm is nonpreemptive(CPU has to complete the process in
present before jumping off to the next process)

FCFS cannot take part in time-sharing systems because its nonpreemptive

Convoy effect is when processes with higher burst times arrive before
processes with lower burst time due to which avg burst time increases

turnaround time = completion time - arrival time
waiting time = turnaround time - burst time
